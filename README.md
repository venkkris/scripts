# Scripts
Collection of python and shell scripts I use for running DFT calculations using the GPAW software on our Arjuna computer cluster.

# Helpful git commands
`git commit -S -m "Commit message"` to sign the commit.

`git fetch` to fetch from Github to local, but does not update local. 

`git pull` fetches from remote to local and also updates local.

`git push` to push changes from local to remote (i.e. Github).
