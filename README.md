# scripts
Collection of python and shell scripts I use for running DFT calculations using the GPAW software on our Arjuna computer cluster.

# Helpful commands
`git fetch https://github.com/venkkris/scripts` to fetch from Github to local.
`git push` to push changes from local to remote (i.e. Github).
