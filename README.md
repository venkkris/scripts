# scripts
Collection of python and shell scripts I use for running DFT calculations using the GPAW software on our Arjuna computer cluster.

# Helpful commands
`git fetch` to fetch from Github to local. 

`git pull` does something similar I guess?

`git push` to push changes from local to remote (i.e. Github).
